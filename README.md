# Colour-Detection-
This project is a simple machine learning-based color detection system built using Python, OpenCV, and Google Colab. It allows users to upload an image and detect colors by clicking on different areas of the image. When a pixel is clicked, the app shows the color name and RGB values in real time.

📌 Features
Detects the name of the color from any image.

Shows RGB values of the selected pixel.

Uses OpenCV for image processing.

Includes a preloaded color dataset (CSV) for matching.

Works seamlessly in Google Colab.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Pandas

scikit-learn (KNN for optional ML classification)

Google Colab

🖼️ How It Works
Upload an image.

Click anywhere on the image.

It displays the color name and RGB value of the clicked pixel.
